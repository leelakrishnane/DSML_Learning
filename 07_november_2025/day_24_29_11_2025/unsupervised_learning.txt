Unsupervised Learning is the process of manipulating data without the Target or Label

In Simple Term, the process of doing the activity only with X-data /Input data/
Independent Data / Feature Data

Types of Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
1. PCA - Principle Component Analysis
    1.1 PCA can be part of Feature Extraction
    1.2 PCA can also be called as Dimensionality Reduction Technique
2. Clustering
    2.1 K-Means Clustering
    2.2 Agglomerative Clustering
    2.3 Divisive Clustering
3. DB Scan
    3.1 This can also be used for finding the outlier
4. T-SNE (Neighborhood Embedding)
    4.1 It is used only for Visualization
    4.2 It is also a kind of Dimensionality Reduction Technique
    4.3 This can also be used for finding the outlier
