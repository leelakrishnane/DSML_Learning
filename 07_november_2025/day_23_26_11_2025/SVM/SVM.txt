Support Vector Machine.

Layer:

SVR - Regression
SVC - Classification

Machine Learning ---> Supervised Learning Algorithm

Important:

1. Margin
2. Support Vector
3. Hyperplane
4. Kernel - RBF - polynomial

4 .1 Choosing Kernel:
   Note: we cant decide the kernel by just knowing the data.
         Start with basic linear kernel and go with rest
   To know best: Hyperparameter Tuning(Grid Search or Random Search)

Best: for classification
Used when: Non-Linear
Most: High Dimensional

Example: Image Recognition, spam detection,
