Data Science ---> It is the process of understanding the inbuilt pattern,
analysis, forecasting, prediction of the data.

Structured Data - MACHINE LEARNING

CSV, EXCEL, DB(SQL, ORACLE),JSON

Un-Structured Data - DEEP LEARNING

Data Science + Machine Learning

Machine Learning: This is mechanism or algorithm in which it is going to help
us in prediction and data analysis of structured data through some inbuilt libraries.

Data Analytics:

It is first level to the Data science. Finding and analysing the data and
showcasing it in picture or visualization way to for the better understanding.

Programming Language:

Primary Focus:

Python(Machine Learning) ---> DA + DS

Secondary Focus:

PowerBI or Tableau ---> DA (Visualization) (DS)
GITHUB ----> Code Versioning (DA + DS)
SQL or Oracle or Mongo ----> Storage (DA + DS)
CSV or EXCEL ---> File Storage(DA + DS)

Optional:
MS Excel ---> DA
