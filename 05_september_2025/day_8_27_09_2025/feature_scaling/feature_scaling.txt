Process of converting Number from one form to another form 

Feature Scaling (Input Data):

1. Standardization 
2. Normalization

Library:

1. from sklearn.preprocessing StandardScaler
2. from sklearn.preprocessing MinMaxScaler

When we should go for this feature scaling ?

1. Whenever we use the model that working based on the distance based algorithm. 
2. Imagine we have dataset contains following columns 
    2.1 Price (Rupees - 30000,40000,50000)
    2.2 No_of _Bedrooms (integer - 2,3,4)
    2.3 City_rating (2,3,4,5)
    


Supervised:
1. KNN (K-Nearest Neighbour)
2. SVM(Support Vector machine)

Unsupervised:
1. K-Means clustering
2. DBScan
3. Hierarical Clustering 

StandardScaler:
1. It can have negative value
2. It produces normal distribution

MinMaxScaler:
1. It will show only positive value
2. It produces uniform distribution

Distribution:
How data is spread across the sheet or column.
