DB Scan means density based spatial clustering
It doesnt make the cluster to be declined or formed 
It forms the automatic grouping based on the density

Minimum number of point requried to form a cluster
Epsilon - maximum distance between two points to be consider as the neighbour 

Flow of DB scanning
It randomly picks the point and checks for the distance with another point(data) and checks for the minimum points 
till it attains "core point" and becomes a cluster

If randomly picked point cannot be part of the core point is called as "Noise" (Outlier)

Step 1: Pick up the unvisited point and evaluate the possibility of clustering
Step 2: Expand the cluster till it attracts the neighbour 
Step 3: Cluster formation stops if no more point can be added

Attribute: 
Core-point : Minimum point within an Epsilon range
Border Point : It might have lesser minimum point but within the epsilon of core point
Noise POint: Outlier (Noise)
