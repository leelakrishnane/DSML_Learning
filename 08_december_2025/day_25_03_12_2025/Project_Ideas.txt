Hierarchical clustering is best when you want understandable structures and a tree-like relationship between groups.

Customer Segmentation in Marketing (Small Datasets)

Example: A luxury brand with a few hundred customers may use hierarchical clustering to see how their customers naturally group (e.g., based on income, spending habits, product preferences).

The dendrogram helps managers see how clusters merge step by step.

Document / Text Clustering

In research or legal document classification, hierarchical clustering is used to build topic hierarchies (e.g., "Sports → Cricket → IPL").

Biological Taxonomy (DNA/Genes)

In bioinformatics, hierarchical clustering is used to group genes/proteins based on similarity.

Example: Building a tree of life from DNA sequences.

Anomaly Detection (Small Sets)

Network packets, fraud detection on small scale — hierarchical clustering can show outliers at different levels.


=============================================


K-Means works well for large datasets, where you already know or assume an approximate number of clusters.

Customer Segmentation in Retail/E-commerce

Amazon, Flipkart, or Myntra: clustering millions of customers into groups like “bargain hunters,” “brand lovers,” “frequent buyers.”

Helps in personalized recommendations.

Image Compression / Segmentation

Reduces image colors by clustering pixels into k dominant colors → smaller file size.

Used in apps like Instagram filters, medical imaging.

Market Basket Analysis

Clustering shopping patterns from supermarket transactions.

Example: Grouping shoppers who buy bread + butter + jam vs. those who buy chips + soft drinks.

Document / News Article Grouping

Google News uses k-means-like clustering to group news stories covering the same event.

Sensor Data / IoT

Grouping patterns from smart devices (like temperature readings, fitness trackers) to detect common behaviors.
