hierarchical clustering is similar to k- means.

It has two types:

1. top down hierarchical clustering(agglomerative)
2. bottom up hierarchical clustering(Divise)

Functionality:

1. Each point will be considered as the cluster.
2. then distance is calculated
3. then points which is near by to those cluster will become
one cluster.
4. this formation happen till the limit we set.
5. This is also one of the distance based algorithm only.

Models or Library to use:

1. for Agglomerative

  from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering
  from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import linkage,

2. Divisive
    from sklearn.cluster import BisectingKMeans

Linkage:
--------
'ward',
'single',
'complete',
'average'
