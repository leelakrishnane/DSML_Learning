Association/ Recommendation are similar to KNN Clustering model 
It can be part of supervised or unsupervised model 

Eg - KNN which is part of supervised algorithm can be termed as a Recommendation style 
Association -  There are few models algorithm which are specifically designed for association 

Eg. APRIORI
Association models can be of two types 
1. Association rule learning (APRIORI)
2. Association classification 

Recommendation 
1. Collaborative Filtering (Netflix) - Unsupervised
2. Content based filtering (Spotify) - Supervised

Program Template

from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity - Recommendation 
from mlxtend.frequent_pattern import apriori, association_rules - Association 

Installation
